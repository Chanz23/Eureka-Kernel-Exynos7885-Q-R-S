/*
 * All operation messages (both requests and responses) begin with
 * a common header that encodes the size of the data (header
 * included).  This header also contains a unique identifier, which
 * is used to keep track of in-flight operations.  Finally, the
 * header contains a operation type field, whose interpretation is
 * dependent on what type of device lies on the other end of the
 * connection.  Response messages are distinguished from request
 * messages by setting the high bit (0x80) in the operation type
 * value.
 *
 * The wire format for all numeric fields in the header is little
 * endian.  Any operation-specific data begins immediately after the
 * header, and is 64-bit aligned.
