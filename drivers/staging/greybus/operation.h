/*
 * A Greybus operation is a remote procedure call performed over a
 * connection between the AP and a function on Greybus module.
 * Every operation consists of a request message sent to the other
 * end of the connection coupled with a reply returned to the
 * sender.
 *
 * The state for managing active requests on a connection is held in
 * the connection structure.
 *
 * YADA YADA
 *
 * submitting each request and providing its matching response to
 * the caller when it arrives.  Operations normally complete
 * asynchronously, and when an operation's response arrives its
 * callback function is executed.  The callback pointer is supplied
 * at the time the operation is submitted; a null callback pointer
 * causes synchronous operation--the caller is blocked until
 * the response arrives.  In addition, it is possible to await
 * the completion of a submitted asynchronous operation.
 *
 * A Greybus device operation includes a Greybus buffer to hold the
 * data sent to the device.  The only field within a Greybus
 * operation that should be used by a caller is the payload pointer,
 * which should be used to populate the request data.  This pointer
 * is guaranteed to be 64-bit aligned.
 * XXX and callback?
