  gbuf

  This is the "main" data structure to send / receive Greybus messages

  There are two different "views" of a gbuf structure:
    - a greybus driver
    - a greybus host controller

  A Greybus driver needs to worry about the following:
    - creating a gbuf
    - putting data into a gbuf
    - sending a gbuf to a device
    - receiving a gbuf from a device

  Creating a gbuf:
    A greybus driver calls greybus_alloc_gbuf()
  Putting data into a gbuf:
    copy data into gbuf->transfer_buffer
  Send a gbuf:
    A greybus driver calls greybus_submit_gbuf()
    The completion function in a gbuf will be called if the gbuf is successful
    or not.  That completion function runs in user context.  After the
    completion function is called, the gbuf must not be touched again as the
    greybus core "owns" it.  But, if a greybus driver wants to "hold on" to a
    gbuf after the completion function has been called, a reference must be
    grabbed on the gbuf with a call to greybus_get_gbuf().  When finished with
    the gbuf, call greybus_free_gbuf() and when the last reference count is
    dropped, it will be removed from the system.
  Receive a gbuf:
    A greybus driver calls gb_register_cport_complete() with a pointer to the
    callback function to be called for when a gbuf is received from a specific
    cport and device.  That callback will be made in user context with a gbuf
    when it is received.  To stop receiving messages, call
    gb_deregister_cport_complete() for a specific cport.


  Greybus Host controller drivers need to provide
    - a way to allocate the transfer buffer for a gbuf
    - a way to free the transfer buffer for a gbuf when it is "finished"
    - a way to submit gbuf for transmissions
    - notify the core the gbuf is complete
    - receive gbuf from the wire and submit them to the core
    - a way to send and receive svc messages
  Allocate a transfer buffer
    the host controller function alloc_gbuf_data is called
  Free a transfer buffer
    the host controller function free_gbuf_data is called
  Submit a gbuf to the hardware
    the host controller function submit_gbuf is called
  Notify the gbuf is complete
    the host controller driver must call greybus_gbuf_finished()
  Submit a SVC message to the hardware
    the host controller function send_svc_msg is called
  Receive gbuf messages
    the host controller driver must call greybus_cport_in() with the data
  Reveive SVC messages from the hardware
    The host controller driver must call greybus_svc_in
